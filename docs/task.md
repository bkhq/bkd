- [x] **BUG-078 Fix tool-use message toolCallId association for parallel tool calls** `P1`
  - description: normalizeLog in claude.ts only captured the first tool_use/tool_result block per message (using `.find()`), dropping all subsequent blocks when Claude sends parallel tool calls (common with Grep/Glob searches). Frontend SessionMessages.tsx only paired consecutive tool-call/result entries, failing for non-adjacent pairs. Fixed: (1) Backend extracts ALL tool_use/tool_result blocks from assistant/user messages, returning arrays when multiple exist. (2) normalizeStream and issue-engine parser types updated to accept arrays. (3) Frontend uses a pre-built `resultByCallId` Map for O(1) lookup instead of consecutive-only pairing.

  - createdAt: 2026-02-26 22:30

- [x] **BUG-079 Fix git changes badge stuck at "0 个文件已更改"** `P1`
  - description: ChatInput's file changes badge always showed 0 because `useChangesSummary` was purely SSE-driven with no initial REST fetch. Three issues: (1) No initial load — if session already completed before page opened, badge stayed at 0 forever. (2) Updates only fire on `onIssueSettled` — no data during or after execution. (3) SSE connection missing on mobile — `useEventConnection` only called in `AppSidebar` which isn't rendered on mobile. Fixed: (1) Rewrote `useChangesSummary` to fetch initial data via React Query from existing `/changes` REST endpoint, with SSE overlay for real-time updates. (2) Added `useEventConnection` at page level for mobile in both `IssueDetailPage` and `KanbanPage`. (3) SSE updates also invalidate the React Query cache so DiffPanel stays in sync.

- [x] **PERF-004 Strip file-read content from DB and simplify frontend display** `P2`
  - description: File-read tool-use results were storing full file content in the `issueLogs` table (bloating DB) and rendering it in the frontend chat. Backend now strips content from file-read tool-result entries before DB persistence (in-memory SSE stream unchanged). Frontend `FileToolGroup` renders file-read as a compact inline path label instead of an expandable code block. Removed unused `normalizeFileReadOutput` function.

- [x] **ARCH-015 Use readable nanoid (no special chars) for project and issue IDs** `P1`
  - description: Replace default `nanoid(8)` (alphabet `A-Za-z0-9_-`) in `shortId()` with `customAlphabet('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789', 8)` so project and issue IDs contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, improving URL readability and consistency with the existing project alias format.

- [-] **FEAT-005 Add global web terminal (xterm.js + Bun native PTY)** `P1`
  - description: Global web terminal accessible from sidebar. Desktop: bottom drawer (like VS Code). Mobile: full-page `/terminal` route. Backend: Bun native PTY via `Bun.spawn({ terminal })` with binary WebSocket protocol. Frontend: xterm.js singleton with auto-reconnect, Zustand store for drawer state.

- [x] **FEAT-006 Queue follow-up messages as pending during active AI turn** `P1`
  - description: When an issue is in "working" status and the AI engine has an active turn in-flight, follow-up messages are persisted as pending (`metadata.pending=true`) instead of being sent to the engine mid-turn. After the turn completes, pending messages are auto-detected and flushed as a new follow-up turn before moving the issue to review. Frontend shows pending indicator for messages sent during active turns.

- [x] **FEAT-007 Cancel active processes when issue transitions to done** `P1`
  - description: When an issue's status changes to `done` (via single PATCH or bulk PATCH), fire-and-forget cancel any active background processes for that issue using `issueEngine.cancelIssue()`. Prevents orphaned AI processes from continuing after the user marks work as complete.

- [x] **ARCH-016 Redesign issue_log_tools → issue_logs_tools_call** `P1`
  - description: Renamed table to issue_logs_tools_call, simplified schema by removing 12 granular columns (file_path, command, search_query, etc.) in favor of a single raw JSON field, added tool_call_ref_id forward reference in issues_logs. toolAction reconstructed from raw JSON via rawToToolAction().

Supports up to 10 files, 10MB each.

- [x] **BUG-081 Fix terminal: SSE transport, default shell, encoding, session persistence** `P1`
  - description: Replaced WebSocket with SSE+POST transport (WS didn't work through Vite proxy). (1) Detect user's default shell from /etc/passwd via getent. (2) Set TERM=xterm-256color and LANG=C.UTF-8 for proper encoding. (3) Session persistence: server-side session map with PTY per session ID, frontend keeps session across drawer open/close, reattaches xterm.js DOM element. (4) Separate "hide" (X) from "kill" (trash icon) in UI. API: POST /terminal → create, GET /terminal/:id → SSE output, POST /terminal/:id/input → input, POST /terminal/:id/resize → resize, DELETE /terminal/:id → kill.

Refactored IssueEngine to delegate process registration, group indexing, concurrency limits, and auto-cleanup to PM. Refactored terminal.ts to use PM for session management. Removed 3 redundant Maps and 4 methods from IssueEngine.

- [-] **BUG-080 Fix duplicate Claude process spawning for same session** `P0`
  - description: `handleTurnCompleted()` sets `managed.state = 'completed'` while the subprocess is still alive (conversational engines keep process running between turns). `getActiveProcessForIssue()` only finds `running`/`spawning` states, so follow-up calls spawn a new `--resume` process, creating duplicate processes for the same session. Fix: keep `managed.state = 'running'` after turn completes (subprocess IS alive), add `turnSettled` flag for DB/event handling, and add safety guard in `spawnFollowUpProcess()` to kill old processes.

## Deferred / Won't Do

- [~] **ARCH-001 Repository interface for data layer** — Routes use Drizzle directly; abstraction unnecessary for current scale.
- [~] **SEC-014 Rate limiting** — Personal project, not exposed to public internet.
- [~] **SEC-015 Filesystem path traversal re-fix** — Deferred pending workspace setting architecture.
- [~] **SEC-AUTH-001 Fail-open auth and CORS wildcard** — Personal tool, fail-open by design in dev. Audit ref: SEC-AUTH-001.
- [~] **SEC-RATE-001 API rate limiting** — Duplicate of SEC-014, personal tool. Audit ref: SEC-RATE-001.
- [~] **FE-088 ChatInput internal padding** — Kept compact per UI preference.
- [~] **FE-123 IssueListPanel/IssueDetail consolidation** — Minimal overlap found in audit.
