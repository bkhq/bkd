# BKD API Reference

Base URL: `/api`

## Response Envelope

Most JSON CRUD responses use a standard envelope. Exceptions include binary/file download endpoints (which return raw streams) and `/api/runtime` (which returns a raw object).

```json
{ "success": true, "data": T }
{ "success": false, "error": "message" }
```

## Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | OK |
| `201` | Created |
| `202` | Accepted (async operation started) |
| `400` | Bad Request (validation error) |
| `403` | Forbidden |
| `404` | Not Found |
| `409` | Conflict |
| `429` | Too Many Requests |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

## Validation

All POST/PATCH routes use Zod schema validation via `@hono/zod-validator`. Validation errors return `400` with comma-separated error messages.

## Soft Deletion

Database-backed DELETE operations (projects, issues, notes, webhooks, etc.) use an `isDeleted` flag — data is never hard-deleted. However, some endpoints perform **irreversible** deletions: file DELETE (`/api/files/*`) removes files from disk, and worktree DELETE (`/api/worktrees/*`) physically removes Git worktrees.

## Security

### Headers

- **CSP**: `default-src 'self'`, inline scripts/styles allowed, frames blocked, object-src none
- **HSTS**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- **CORS**: Configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` env var (comma-separated origins or `*`). Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS. Credentials enabled when origin is not `*`.

### Request Protection

- Workspace root boundary validation (SEC-016)
- Git command injection prevention (SEC-019)
- Workspace directory confinement (SEC-022)
- XSS prevention via `Content-Disposition: attachment` (SEC-024)
- Symlink traversal prevention via `realpath()` (SEC-025)
- SSRF protection on webhook URLs (private/internal network blocking)
- MCP API key uses timing-safe comparison

### Compression

gzip/deflate compression on all routes except SSE (`/api/events`), streaming (`*/stream`), and MCP (`/api/mcp*`).
