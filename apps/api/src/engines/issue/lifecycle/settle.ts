/** Common settle flow: persist status, auto-move, clean domain data, emit event.
 *
 * NOTE: Worktree cleanup is NOT done here. Worktrees are preserved across
 * completed/failed settlements so follow-ups can reuse them. Cleanup is
 * handled by the periodic background job in jobs/worktree-cleanup.ts.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: emitIssueSettled() MUST always fire — the SSE route filters
 * terminal states from the 'state' subscriber and only sends them via the
 * 'done' subscriber. If emitIssueSettled is skipped, the frontend never
 * receives a terminal event and stays stuck in "thinking" state forever.
